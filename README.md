# Classical Ciphers
A collection of simple classical ciphers implemented in C++. 
The original idea came from an exercise in the Beginning C++ Programming course on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/), which implemented the basic functionality of the substitution cipher.

## Currently implemented
 - Substitution cipher
 - Caeser Cipher 

Obviously, these are not secure ciphers. I don't take responsibility if you use these to encrypt sensitive information. 

## Usage
Feel free to use this code, as long as credit is provided. As stated previously, this is an insecure encryption method and I do not take responsiblity for how you use it.

## Current limitations and planned features:
- Only characters A-Z, a-z and 0-9 can be encrypted
- Currently no way to modify alphabet or key strings without modifying the source code and rebuilding the substitution cipher
